# JobPortal Website
## RETRACE:
RETRACE is a web application built with React, Node.js, and MySQL that allows job seekers to find job listings and employers to post job openings.
There are many job search portals in the market. the ultimate moto of my project is to provide a platform for searching and posting different categories of jobs such as:-
      1)part time jobs : commonly students and people look for some extra money can make use of it
      2)permanent      :graduates and proffesional with experienced can register on this category 
      3)contract       : this category make our project unique and most needed because in this category the employers aswell as users can find a job which is required only for       
                       particular period of time, we all may face a carrer gap or some situation we need a change of work by this we  can earn learn  that particular job and its scope 
                       of growth etc.. 
      4)service        :In this category any one require an service from people as a help most commonly a can be used for gathering peoples for doing social etc.... 
      5)others         :Its a catergory if there's any exceptional cases,
